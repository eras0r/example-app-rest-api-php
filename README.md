example-app-rest-api-php
========================
This little example application gives an idea to build a php REST JSON interface based on [tonic](http://www.peej.co.uk/tonic/).
It uses a little MySQL database to persist the data.

1. Make sure you have [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) installed.
2. clone the repository 
3. navigate the the direcory where your clone is located
4. type in ```composer install``` (assuming composer is installed globally)
5. use the scripts within the sql folder to create the required table and fill it with some data if you like.
